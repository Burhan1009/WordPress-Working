Here is a `README.md` file based on the commands you provided. This assumes that your project is about setting up a Kubernetes cluster using `kind`, deploying WordPress with MySQL, and port forwarding for access:

```markdown
# Kubernetes Cluster Setup for WordPress and MySQL

This project demonstrates how to set up a local Kubernetes cluster using `kind` (Kubernetes in Docker), deploy WordPress with MySQL, and access them using port forwarding.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Kubernetes Cluster using `kind`

Navigate to the directory where your `config.yml` file is located and create a `kind` cluster:

```bash
cd kind/
kind create cluster --name=website --config=config.yml
```

### 2. Check the Created Clusters

To verify that the cluster has been created successfully, run:

```bash
kind get clusters
```

### 3. Apply Kubernetes Configurations

Next, apply the Kubernetes manifests to set up your WordPress and MySQL resources.

```bash
cd kubernetes/

# Apply the namespace
kubectl apply -f namespace.yml

# Apply the MySQL deployment and service
kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f mysql-service.yml

# Apply the WordPress deployment and service
kubectl apply -f wordpress-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f wordpress-service.yml
```

### 4. Check Resources in the Namespace

To verify the deployment of all resources in the `wordpress-namespace`, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get all -n wordpress-namespace
```

### 5. Watch the Resources

To watch the resources in real-time as they get created, use the `-w` flag:

```bash
kubectl get all -n wordpress-namespace -w
```

### 6. Port-Forwarding for Local Access

To access the WordPress and MySQL services locally, use the following port-forwarding commands:

#### Access WordPress:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/wordpress 8080:80 -n wordpress-namespace
```

You can change the port if needed:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/wordpress 8100:80 -n wordpress-namespace
```

#### Access MySQL:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/mysql 3307:3306 -n wordpress-namespace
```

### 7. Cleanup

To delete the cluster after use, you can run:

```bash
kind delete cluster --name=website
```

---

## Additional Notes

- Make sure the `namespace.yml`, `mysql-deployment.yml`, `mysql-service.yml`, `wordpress-deployment.yml`, and `wordpress-service.yml` files are properly configured for your use case.
- The port-forwarding allows you to access the WordPress application at `localhost:8080` or `localhost:8100` and MySQL at `localhost:3307`.

## Troubleshooting

- If the `kind create cluster` command fails, ensure that Docker is running properly on your machine.
- If `kubectl get pods` shows that the pods are not running, check the logs of the respective pods using:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name> -n wordpress-namespace
  ```

For further details on `kind`, refer to the [official documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).
